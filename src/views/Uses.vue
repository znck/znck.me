          If I get to choose again, I would probably go for a 13-inch MacBook Pro with maxed-out specs as it's more
          compact and portable. For now, I am hoping for a Ryzen based MacBook Pro lineup.

          <AppLink to="https://amzn.to/2BEAxWa" external>Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black</AppLink> <br />

          It's quite heavier and larger than my last phone (iPhone 7) but now I am kinda conditioned to it but I am on
          constant lookout for a smaller iPhone.<br />

          <br />

          I want to reduce my screen time and currently I am considering getting the

          It's good and cheap; works well for casual gaming and Netflix binges. However, blacks would appear washed out
          in a bright room and built-in speakers are terrible. You would have to pair it with a good speaker setup (It
          support HDMI ARC, so that's a plus).
