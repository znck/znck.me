        Hi there,
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I am a self-taught software engineer with a passion for building accessible web apps, developer tooling, and
        open-source. I am a (rather inactive) member of the Vue.js Core Team and I am also an alumnus of IIT Guwahati.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I like to build things for developers. And last few years, I have been working on Grammarly for Developers at
        Grammarly. As of 10th January 2024, Grammarly for Developers is discontinued and I am looking for the next
        thing. I am open to new opportunities and I am always looking for a role where
        <em>I can work on developer-focused open-source products</em>.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Write to me at <a href="mailto:hey@znck.me">hey@znck.me</a> if you have something interesting to discuss.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I am also available for speaking at conferences and meetups. You can find my previous talks on this website.
